Language Extensions

  vars...       A place to put persistent data

  always...     A place to put functions to be continuously called

  once {...},   Once-wrapped code is evaluated only on the first compile.
  nonce {...}   Thereafter, 'once' degenerates to 'nonce'.
                Switch 'nonce' -> 'once' to compile again.
                (this feature partially replaces a REPL + history)

  clear()       Clears everything: vars, always, setTimout tasks, canvas

Coding Tools

  help(-)       Looks inside any object/function (useful for hacking :)

  print(-),     Prints messages to log area
  error(-)

  assert(-,-)   assert(condition, message) throws if 'condition' is false

Audio (using HTML5 audio elements)

  encodeWav(-)  Encodes an array of [-1,1]-valued samples -> wav data uri

  play(-)       Plays a wav data uri (eg as generated by encodeWav)

  tone(-)       Generates and encodes a linearly-ramped sine wave
                (see examples or try help(tone) for details)

  noise(-)      Generates and encodes broad or narrow band noise
                (see examples or try help(tone) for details)

  sampleRate,   Constants in kHz (all time units are ms or kHz)
  middleC

Graphics (using HTML5 canvas)

  context       A 2D canvas context

  mouseX,       Current mouse coordinates in pixels
  mouseY

Keyboard Shortcuts

  ESCAPE        pause/continue compiling code
                (useful for atomic modifications)

  CTRL+S        save code locally
  CTRL+O        show list of local scripts

  F1            show/hide help (this message)
